#ProgrammingExercises

*This project is consist of my programming exercises. Mainly about exercises from the book "Craking the Coding Interview" and basic data structure implementation*

###DATA STRUCTURE
1. **TRIE**
    - Add
    - Delete

###OPERATOR
1. **EXCLUSIVE OR**
2. **BITWISE OPERATIONS**
3. **TERNARY OPERATORS**

###ALGORITHMS
1. **INSERTION SORT**
2. **MERGE SORT**
3. **HEAP SORT**
4. **QUICK SORT**
5. **COUNTING SORT**

###EXERCISE FROM CRACKING THE CODING INTERVIEW
1. **EXERCISE 19-10**
    - Use a function that generate Integer in range (1, 5) to generate Interger in range (1, 7) randomly
    - There are various implementations for this exercise. **An interesting question is how to control the distribution if needed.** If there is any restriction on the output, can the new integer generator remain the same distribution? For uniform distribution, it is possible. However, if the origin generator outputs in normal distribution, some integral transform is required
2. **EXERCISE 19-08**
    - Need more clarification: how many searches will I need to perform? If more than once, I need to build a table for the frequency of each word. Besides, is the search case-sensitive? Should singular/plural, possessive forms of nouns to be considered?
3. **EXERCISE 19-05**
4. **EXERCISE 19-03**
5. **EXERCISE 19-01**
6. **EXERCISE 19-05**
    - Reflection and Annotation in Java
7. **EXERCISE 14-04**
8. **EXERCISE 14-03**
9. **EXERCISE 14-02**
10. **EXERCISE 14-01**
11. **EXERCISE 11-01**
12. **EXERCISE 10-07**
	- Solved with brute force ):
13. **EXERCISE 10-03**

###OTHER TOPICS
