#ProgrammingExercises

*This project is consist of my programming exercises. Mainly about exercises from the book "Craking the Coding Interview" and basic data structure implementation*

##DATA STRUCTURE

1. **TRIE**
    - Add
    - Delete

##EXERCISE FROM CRACKING THE CODING INTERVIEW

1. **EXERCISE 19-10**
    - Use a function that generate Integer in range (1, 5) to generate Interger in range (1, 7) randomly
    - There are various implementations for this exercise. **An interesting question is how to control the distribution if needed.** If there is any restriction on the output, can the new integer generator remain the same distribution? For uniform distribution, it is possible. However, if the origin generator outputs in normal distribution, some integral transform is required
